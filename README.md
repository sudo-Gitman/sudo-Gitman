# About sudo-Gitman

Welcome to the **`sudo-Gitman`** GitHub profile!

## About Me

Hello! I'm **Sreerag**, a passionate developer with a focus on **system administration** and **security automation**. I specialize in creating scripts and tools that help streamline administrative tasks, enhance system security, and improve the efficiency of endpoint management. Most of my work revolves around **PowerShell** and **Bash** scripting, with a keen interest in managing endpoint security solutions like Forcepoint.

## My Projects

Here are a few of the projects that you can find on my GitHub:

- **[ForcepointEndpointDeployment](https://github.com/sudo-Gitman/ForcepointEndpointDeployment)**  
  A PowerShell script designed for automating the deployment and removal of **Forcepoint agents** across endpoints. This tool is useful for administrators looking to efficiently manage Forcepoint agent installations and updates in their environment.

- **[ForcepointProxyManager](https://github.com/sudo-Gitman/ForcepointProxyManager)**  
  This PowerShell script helps manage proxy settings, uninstall Forcepoint One Endpoint, and automate the installation of new Forcepoint agents.

- **[Chrome-Local-State-Modifier](https://github.com/sudo-Gitman/Chrome-Local-State-Modifier)**  
  A Bash script tailored for macOS users to modify the **Google Chrome Local State** file, enabling experimental flags and configuring Chrome settings, like allowing invalid certificates for localhost resources.

## My Philosophy

I believe in the power of automation to reduce manual work, eliminate human errors, and increase the security and reliability of IT infrastructure. My tools are designed to be simple, efficient, and easily adaptable to different environments. I hope my contributions help others in their journey to simplify system administration and ensure robust security.
